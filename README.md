# Furry-Minder

Inspired by the popular 90's toy, Tamagotchi, Furry-Minder helps to incentivize the user to stay productive and on task
by tying the care of the pet to a to-do list. If tasks are finished in a timely manner, the pet will be fed & cared for, 
and continue to grow. However, neglecting your tasks also means neglecting your pet, which will eventually lead to its 
death, and starting all over again.

## Purpose

Each day of our lives, we are faced with filling up our day with tasks that we don’t want to accomplish. We constantly 
have to force ourselves to do them or get something out of it to get the job done. Due to natural human nature, we need 
the incentive to feel accomplished after completing our tasks. To assist in this constant issue, Furry-Minder provides a
solution. The pet helps incentivize the user to stay productive and on task by tying the pet's care to a to-do list. If 
tasks are finished on time, the pet will be fed & cared for and continue to grow. However, neglecting your tasks also 
means neglecting your pet, eventually leading to its death and starting all over again. Furry-Minder’s creation was 
inspired by the popular 90’s toy, Tamagotchi. Similar to Tamagotchi pets, Furry-Minder’s purpose is to incentivize its
users to complete their desired tasks on time while concurrently having an interactive pet to guide them along the way. 
Furry-Minder provides user stimulus as their pet will deteriorate as they fail to complete tasks. If tasks are neglected
for too long, the pet will also be neglected, leading to its death. The user will then have to be assigned a new baby 
pet to start over again. On the flip side, as users complete their tasks, their pet will be given health which allows 
them to grow. All pets will begin as a baby pet and progress to an adult. Further incentives to complete tasks include 
the unlocking of items to customize their pet as well as pet color changes to maximize user motivation of use. Furry-Minder ideally targets users that are predominantly procrastinators and need an extra reward, or in some cases 
punishment,  to get the job done. Furry-Minder is also for those that are nostalgic about the once popular and raving 
Tamagotchi. This may include animal lovers who cannot stand to let a pet suffer, even if it may be electronic. However, 
Furry-Minder is set apart from typical reminder or calendar systems and Tamagotchi due to its mix of innovative stimulus
and practicality. The truth of the matter is: there has been nothing that compares to the combined functionality of 
Furry-Minder out in the real world, until now.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
